    <h1>Solidan is a Higher Education Consulting Firm</h1>
    <p>
      Solidan started in 2005 when it identified a gap between the consulting industry and the lack of understanding 
      of Universities and Colleges.  PeopleSoft was the main SIS software leader.  Recruitment Plus was the leading
      admissions software.  We started a quest to learn and engage all areas of an institution.

      <p>
  <b> Mission </b>
To increase enrollment and retention for our universities and colleges.

    <p>
<b> Core Values  </b>
    </p><p>
	1) We operate as if we see ourselves as applicants, students, and alumni
     </p> <p>
	2) We go above and beyond for our schools and each other
     </p> <p>
	3) We make no excuses
      </p><p>
	4) We do what we say we are going to do when we say we are going to do it
    </p>
    <p>
	5) We are proactive rather than reactive
