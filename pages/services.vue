Donâ€™t hold on to old practices. Let us work side by side with you to help you configure Slate the best way for your college.

  <p>Optimization via the Solidan Slate Health Check</p>
A module based in depth review and analysis of current configurations and processes. Modules included are: application, deliver, events, forms, reader/workflows, query/reports, rules & automations and permissions. Followed by recommendations and/or technical support fill existing gap or to move forward new processes.

  <p>Troubleshooting Support</p>
We understand resources can run thin and projects are horizon because of competing priorities. Or manual work is the workaround because the needed troubleshooting support is not available.   We offer general troubleshooting from experts with specialized knowledge who then provide workable solutions.
